# LuminAI Task Progress Index

Current task: Turn the AI manju research report into an executable industrial AI Film Engine foundation.

## Progress

| Node | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Repository and report scan | Done | Read `AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/complete_ai_manjv_open_source_research_report_2026.md`; confirmed `src/` implementation is missing while tests expect it. |
| 2. Progress index | Done | Created this progress index. |
| 3. Architecture extraction | Done | Added `docs/ai_manjv_engine_execution_plan.md` with report-derived implementation phases. |
| 4. Core implementation | Done | Added `src/apps/comic_gen`, `src/utils`, `src/models`, and `src/film_engine`; `python3 -m pytest -q -s` passed 117 tests. |
| 5. Documentation and samples | Done | Updated `README.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, added `docs/qa_retry_batch_workflow.md`, and added `samples/ai_manjv_factory/episode_factory.yaml`. |
| 6. Verification and cleanup | Done | Final `python3 -m pytest -q -s` passed 117 tests; `git diff --cached --check` passed; generated `output/` and Python caches were removed. |
| 7. Commit and push | Done | Necessary changes are committed and pushed to `origin/main`. |

## Notes

- Work is constrained by `AGENTS.md`: graph workflow, ECS-inspired state, runtime abstraction, prompt compiler, modular systems, QA, retry, and batch production.
- No sub-agents are used for this task.
